1.a) Meaning behind the name

    The name 'sator' comes from the Latin palindrome "SATOR AREPO TENET OPERA
ROTAS", which, roughly translated means "the farmer uses his plough as his form
of work". This was chosen because the purpose of this tool was to overcome
certain networking limitations which were preventing me from comfortablity
completing a job I was tasked to do (e.g., this was a 'plough' I needed to use
in my work) and also because the reverse SSH nature of the script is somewhat
palindrome-esque.
